# Flickr Task App by Matt Pilcher

The application is for a single page flickr feed.

To run the app, pull down, run npm install, run webpack for production, run webpack-dev-server for local development

DEMO - www.mattpilcher.co.uk/sites/flickr

####Features of the application
- Responsive
- Cross Browser tested (IE, Chrome, Firefox & safari)
- Displaying Flickr public feed images and data modification to allow for it to display correctly
- Ability to search Flickr feed and display results based on tag and input
- Ability to click on tags of already found images to search for that tag
- Created as a single page application in React
- Using Sass and Bootstrap, Webpack
- Using Masonry React Component for clean alignment of images
- Creation of infinite scrolling

Features to add in the future
- Tags section was very large so have shorten it to 115px, I'd like to add a toggle to expand it to show all the tags for that image
- Polish the infinite scrolling, I'd have the images come in one by one to reduce load time.
- Show description html elements
- Add an initial loading animation
- Add more filters
- Add animation effects for the images being displayed
